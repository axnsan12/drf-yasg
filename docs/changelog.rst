**1.2.0**
*********

- **ADDED:** ``basePath`` is now generated by taking into account the ``SCRIPT_NAME`` variable and the
  longest common prefix of API urls (:issue:`37`, :pr:`42`)

  (i.e. when accesing the schema view for v1, v2 endpoints will not be included in swagger)

*********
**1.1.3**
*********

- **FIXED:** schema view cache will now always ``Vary`` on the ``Cookie`` and ``Authentication`` (the
  ``Vary`` header was previously only added if ``public`` was set to ``True``) - this fixes issues related to Django
  authentication in ``swagger-ui`` and ``CurrentUserDefault`` values in the schema
